# MedSafe

## Introduction

MedSafe puts you in charge of your important health documents and history by allowing you to individually grant/revoke access to healthcare providers and other third parties in a cryptographically secure manner.

Your encrypted documents are stored on IPFS (by default) or another storage platform.
By using NuCypher's proxy re-encryption, we are able to safely allow and revoke view permissions to healthcare providers or insurance agencies about your important health documents and history.
